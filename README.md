Uses C# and XNA GameStudio 4.0.
Used to make levels for use in other XNA games and also make png files for said XNA games.

To Use:
1. Draw rectangle with your mouse by clicking and dragging on the screen. 
	You can set textures with dropdown combo box.
	To use colors, set texture to "white".
2. To edit the objects drawn to the screen, hit the edit button. 
	Click and drag black corners to resize.
	Click and drag object to move.
3. To switch between drawing and editing, click their respective buttons.

4. Set background by going to Textures/background

5. Add textures by going to Textures/Add
	Only works to load backgrounds atm
6. Add Types by going to Types/Add and clicking the Add button

7. Change Attributes like size name color by right clicking on object and clicking on the attributes
   dropdown buttom

8. To delete right click and click delete. Make sure there is no rectangle underneith the rectangle you
   want to delete. TODO: Fix that



Broken:
1. File/Save as does not work, use Textures/export/PNG to export the whole png file.
	use Level/export to export LevelObjects to .xml file.	
2. cant reload xml files
3. And a lot more
